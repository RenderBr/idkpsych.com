            hi, my name is julian seitz. i am a student of software development, and a psychology hobbyist.
            <br /><br />

            welcome to my psychology website. i hope you find something interesting here.
            <br /><br />
            i like writing about all sorts of stuff. mostly, i enjoy exploring mental health, cognitive science and
            human behavior.
            my writing style is casual, maybe a little unconventional. but i like to think that makes it more
            approachable.
            <br /><br />
            i struggle with anxiety, depression, and addiction (substance abuse). part of why i am interested in
            psychology is to understand myself better, and to help others who might be going through similar challenges.
            <br /><br />
            i am not a doctor, therapist, or licensed professional. this website is not a substitute for professional
            help. if you are struggling with mental health issues, please reach out to a qualified professional.
            <br /><br />
            i'm simply a passionate soul, who craves real connection and understanding.
