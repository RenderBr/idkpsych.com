# i’m thankful for my mind.

“thanks mind.” it’s like, burning toast, and your smoke detector goes off. is something wrong? no.

is your smoke detector doing it’s job? yes.

thank your mind for doing its job, which is to tell stories. your internal narrator is always working, give it some appreciation. 

we tell stories because they’re interesting to listen to. as a child, you may have watched a horrifying movie, maybe one where something lives in the walls, or one where everyone’s apparently a kidnapper.

this scares the shit out of you for some time, and you now have a fear of whatever the movie was about.

but, as you go through life you begin to realize what you watched was fiction, and not indicative of everyday life. sure, bad things DO happen, but they don’t happen nearly as often as the story you bought into.

this is the same way with your mind. it is always thinking. and most of the time it’s thinking about fiction. thank your mind for it’s creativity, and dedication to it’s craft. it does a fantastic job at being a narrator, doesn’t it?
