# patterns

patterns are special.

they're so special we've implemented patterns into every avenue of our lives

and i'm not just talking about you and i.

everyone. every animal, every living being.

they're interwoven in music, they're in decor.

language, nature...

behaviour.

look around you, and notice what patterns you see

there are likely at least a few.

what constitutes a pattern? could a piece of paper be a pattern?

it is all white, and doesn't *really* change, so i'd call it a pattern

the most interesting part is: "why do us humans even like patterns?"

what is it about them that we like?

it's actually pretty interesting, and mostly comes down to survival

patterns are fundamentally things we recognize as "the same".

randomness is the essence of unrecognizeable or predictable characteristics

and this takes more mental energy from us than a predictable pattern

patterns let us process information faster... with less effort

it helped early humans survive, with association of danger.

"loud noises" = bad, run. follow this simple pattern and survive.

there's a reason why the brain makes patterns feel good, and that's exactly why

for our survival, and for our energy conservation

so this makes sense why we fall into patterns then, because patterns are easy

patterns require less effort

if you're an alcoholic and the choice is: resist having a drink and have a drink

and you've made it a pattern to drink

what is the brain going to prefer?

the drink.

the brain rewards patterns

so even though drinking less might be a goal of yours, your reward system is wired otherwise

because humans don't like change. they like patterns.

it doesn't mean we're stuck the way we are.

it doesn't mean you have to listen to your brain's every urge and compulsion

it doesn't mean you can't break free

it just explains why it may be hard, to break free

to say no

to be healthier

to have a better mindset

to wanna be when all you wanted was to go

to live life free, when your brain won't stop telling you no

but you have control over your actions

while we may not have control over our brains

we can always pause, and choose what to do

so, break a pattern this week

just for the sake of it

make a pattern of breaking patterns

trust me
