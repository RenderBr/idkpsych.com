# noise
what comes from our mind, needn't become stressors. note your thoughts as noise, instead.  

some noise is worth paying attention to, other noise is simply *just there*. noise doesn't always mean something.

think of it like **creaky floorboards**: you may notice your floorboards creaking late at night, and yet, nobody is there. it's simply wood expanding or shifting ever so slightly. do you panic, believing someone is there, or do you recognize this happens and simply let it be?

we let our mind take us to many places. *fear, love, hate.* most people try to avoid or compartmentalize their intrusive thoughts, especially the ones that bother them. some people get mad at their intrusive thoughts and end up lashing out in various areas of their life. some people get so stuck, they give up. they are still living, yet become lifeless.

understanding: "your thoughts mustn't be taken seriously" is the first step in achieving “control” over your emotion. i use the term control loosely, as there is no such thing as controlling the mind. it's a beast that cannot be tamed, and it, almost poetically, has a mind of it's own.

there are two elements to the “mind”. there is the “observant” portion. the one that shifts focus, and reacts. there is also the “thinking mind”, this one is essentially a never-ending stream of random commentary. some of what it comes up with is useful, but most of the time it is just noise. it loves to tell stories. “thanks mind”, you might like to tell it, since it does such a wonderful job.

the “observer”, and the “storyteller”. the storyteller isn't really you, it's a blend of our environment, biology and habits, filling silence to feel useful. the observer however, is a widely untapped market for success, growth, and improvement. it's place of quiet and steadiness. it doesn't demand, or make up stories. it observes.

we don't use our observant mind nearly as much as we should, and this is how some people end up getting stuck, feeling as if they are broken, and can never change. i thought this once too about my own being. that i was stuck. "i could never change."
 
when we get too caught up in our own thoughts, and take them far more seriously than we should, this is something called “cognitive fusion”. it's the act of believing your thoughts too naively, or fusing your reality with them. when we mistake the stories as truth.

it's thinking: “man, i suck at this,” and believing it. feeling it. looking out for evidence as to why you suck at “this”. not letting it go, because you suck at this. never feeling like you're doing enough, because you suck at this.

we all suck at “this”. life. most things. we suck at them because we are inherently flawed creatures. our earliest ancestors have had faulty genetics, conditions, and neurological design flaws. one of those being the amygdala.

while not necessarily faulty, some may say it's a tad bit sensitive for today's societal structure. nowadays, instead of our fears being about bears that might tackle and rip us apart, our fears are much more mundane. first world problems. bills, relationship struggles, our careers, whether we should have that drink or not.

our amygdala is constantly looking for fears. it loves to believe in fears that stem from previous associations. let's say you were listening to “pumped up kicks” when you got a call that your grandma died. now everytime you hear that song, you feel a weight in your stomach, and you can't quite put your finger on why. this is your amygdala in action. 

**“neurons that fire together, wire together.”**

so what? what's the solution you ask? frankly, there is none. our brain is a pain-creating machine. this is how we survived, through pain-tolerance and coping mechanisms. however, there is a way to let it effect you a whole lot less.

cognitive fusion has a counterpart, often called cognitive defusion. it's the act of creating distance between you and a thought you may be “fused with”. observing the stories for what it really is, and accepting them.

so “man, i suck at this.”

what if instead you thought: “i'm having the thought where i believe i suck at this.”

"thanks for telling me that story, mind. you're so creative."

if someone was telling a story outloud right in front of you. you'd probably hear it quite well, maybe take it a bit more seriously with the closeness. maybe be more invested in the story.

if you were across the campfire, talking with your other friends, that “somebody” telling the story outloud seems a bit more like background noise. you may not even pay attention to the words or story being spoken.

this is essentially the idiom known as “cognitive defusion”, and it may take some time to properly understand.
