# noise
what comes from our mind, needn't become stressors. simply note your thoughts as noise.  

some noise is worth paying attention to, other noise is just there. noise doesn't always mean something.

think of it like creaky floorboards. you may notice your floorboards creaking late at night, and yet, nobody is there, it's simply wood expanding or shifting ever so slightly. do you panic, and believe there is someone there? or do you recognize this happens all the time, and simply let it be?

we can let our mind take us to many places. fear, love, hate. most people try and avoid, or compartmentalize their intrusive thoughts, the ones that bother them. some people get mad at their intrusive thoughts, and end up lashing out in various areas of their life. some people get so stuck, they give up. they are still living, yet become lifeless.

understanding your thoughts mustn't be taken seriously is the first step in achieving “control” over your emotion. i use the term control loosely, as there is no such thing as controlling the mind. it's a beast that cannot be tamed, and it, quite literally, has a mind of it's own.

there are two elements of the “mind”, as westerners call it. there is the “observant” portion. the one that shifts focus, and acts instinctively. there is also the “thinking mind”, this one is essentially a stream of conscious distraction. some of what it comes up with is useful, but most of the time it is just noise. it loves to tell stories. “thanks mind”, you might like to think.

we have the “observer”, and the “storyteller”. the storyteller is less about us, and more about our environment, and biology. the observer however, is a widely untapped market for success, growth, and improvement.

we don't use our observant mind nearly as much as we should, and this is how some people end up getting stuck, feeling as if they are broken, and can never change.

you know, i thought this once too about my own being. that i was stuck. i could never change.
 
when we get too caught up in our own thoughts, and take them far seriously than we should, this is something called “cognitive fusion”. it's the act of believing your thoughts, or fusing your reality with them.

it's thinking “man, i suck at this,” and believing it. feeling it. looking out for evidence as to why you suck at “this”.

we all suck at “this”. life. we suck at it because we are inherently flawed creatures. from our earliest ancestors, we have had faulty genetics, conditions, and neurological design flaws. one of those being the amygdala.

while not necessarily faulty, some may say it's a tad bit sensitive for today's societal structure. because nowadays, instead of our fears being bears and other animals that might tackle, and then rip us apart, our fears are now more mundane, first worldly problems. bills, relationship struggles, our careers, whether we should have that drink or not.

our amygdala is constantly looking for fears. it loves to believe in fears that stem from previous associations. let's say you were listening to “pumped up kicks” when you got the call that your grandma died.

now everytime you hear that song, you feel a weight in your stomach, and you can't quite put your finger on why. this is your amygdala in action. 

“neurons that fire together, wire together.”

so what? what's the solution you ask?

frankly, there is none. our brain is a pain-creating machine. this is how we survived, through pain-tolerance and coping mechanisms.

however, there is a way to let it effect you a whole lot less.

cognitive fusion has a counterpart, called cognitive defusion. it's the act of creating distance between you and a thought you may be “fused with”.

so “man, i suck at this.”

what if instead you thought: “i'm having the thought where i believe i suck at this.” 

if someone was telling a story outloud right in front of you. you'd probably hear it quite well, maybe take it a bit more seriously with the closeness. maybe be more invested in the story.

if you were across the campfire, talking with your other friends, that “somebody” telling the story outloud seems a bit more like background noise. you may not even pay attention to the words or story being spoken.

this is essentially the idiom known as “cognitive defusion”, and it may take some time to properly understand.
